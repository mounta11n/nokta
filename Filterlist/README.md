## my personal adblock list/block rules

I have not only blocked ads, but also unnecessary and distracting 'cosmetic' stuff.
I am activly maintaining this list. And I am using this list on the ipad (adguard safari extension) of my own child who is autistic,
so I am trying to make result of my rules family-/child-friendly and as much sensory friendly as possible as well.

### how-to

- just add the following url into your adblocker:

`https://github.com/mounta11n/nokta/Filterlist/Autix.txt`

- i highly (!) recommend [µBlocker Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/)
- if you can't use µBlock Origin (perhaps because you are on safari), my second recommendation is adguard adblocker.

**CAVE**
BEWARE! uBO is (and has always been) COMPLETELY UNRELATED to the website ublock.org
